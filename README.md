> **Note**
> Any repositories that have [MIRROR] in their description are mirrored from my [locally hosted git server](http://birbgitfh224rep6tmdofmr6qlo6wx43umqzt3hjubnncr55sdlfmtad.onion/) and the development happens mainly there. If you want to contribute to them, reach out to me via matrix (@toasterbirb:tchncs.de) and request an account.
