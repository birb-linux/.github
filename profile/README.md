## BirbOS

> **Warning**
> All BirbOS development has been moved to http://birbgitfh224rep6tmdofmr6qlo6wx43umqzt3hjubnncr55sdlfmtad.onion/birb-linux and no further repositories will be mirrored to github. The already existing repositories will stay on github as mirrors for backwards compatibility reasons ([birbos-packages](https://github.com/birb-linux/BirbOS-packages) and [birb](https://github.com/birb-linux/birb) need clear web repositories).

> **Note**
> Any repositories that have [MIRROR] in their description are mirrored from my [selfhosted git server](http://birbgitfh224rep6tmdofmr6qlo6wx43umqzt3hjubnncr55sdlfmtad.onion/) and the development happens mainly there. If you want to contribute to them, reach out to me via matrix (@toasterbirb:tchncs.de) and request an account.
